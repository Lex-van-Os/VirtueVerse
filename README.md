# VirtueVerse
VirtueVerse: A platform for exploring and studying Christian literature

## About
VirtueVerse is an application that allows users to browse through Christian literature by famous Christian authors throughout history. VirtueVerse contains a role based account system. With this, it is possible to register as a user and create a 'study trajectory' for a given book. Through a study trajectory, one can track progress and use tools and goals to help with studying the given content. 

VirtueVerse was created as a part of a school project for my current Bachelor education. For my program, it is required to create a MVC application in Laravel (unless one already has worked with Laravel previously, which I haven't, sadly.).
